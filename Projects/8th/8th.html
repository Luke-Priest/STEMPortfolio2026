            <h1 class="ContentTitle">Before</h1>

            <p class="ContentParagraph">In 7th grade I would use basic HTML and CSS code. For instance I would use basic absolute position and use default font.</p>

            <img alt="My 7th grade page" class="PhotoInfoIMG" src="PagePhotos/7thGrade.png">


            <section class="PhotoInfo">

                <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">This image shows my lack of coding experience. This shows my lack of organized code, theres no section tag. I also didn't style or even position the text or image.</p>

                <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">I also had a lack of experience of how I should make a website look. I didn't pay attention to spacing or the way things are positioned. Neither did I think rounding things off or creating different color sections was important.</p>

                <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">Now, I would critque this page by saying, add some spacing, maybe round off the corners of the images, try to add different colored sections and experiment with fonts.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="Growth">

                <h1 class="ContentTitle">Growth Statement</h1>

                <p class="ContentParagraph">My growth was the complexity of my code. I've learned many coding skills from 7th grade to 8th grade.</p>

            </section>

            <section class="After">

                <h1 class="ContentTitle">After</h1>

                <p class="ContentParagraph">In 8th grade, instead of using basic HTML and CSS code, I now am able to use more complex code. I'm now able to use margins and padding to more efficently postion items, I use multiple professional, I also use javascript.</p>

                <img alt="My 8th grade project page." class="PhotoInfoIMG" src="PagePhotos/8thGradePBL.png">

                <section class="PhotoInfoTwo">

                    <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">This image shows my coding progression. You can see that at the bottom of the first image I added a box with a different color thats positioned in the center of the page. The image is also center and is transparent.</p>

                    <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">In the second image, you see that I styled the image and used section tags and classes unstead of divs that make my code look messy.</p>

                    <p class="PhotoInfoParagraph">In the last image, you can see that I used not only absolute positioning but also padding a margin to change the spacing of the content on the page.</p>
