		<h2>My Growth</h2>
		<p>
			I have grown from knowing little about CADing to being able to use some advanced skills. Before beginning the CADing projects I’ve spent little time in CAD software.
			The most I’ve done was use TinkerCAD, a very simple online CADing website. TinkerCAD served its use in the eighth grade, but outside of that, there was definitely to
			move to an advanced CADing program. In the first quarter of this year we began working on the puzzle cube project. This project allowe3d me to get to understand Autodesk Inventor,
			as I knew very little about the program. The first step of CADing my puzzle cube design, was to make a 2D sketch on the x plane. Using the rectangle tool I completed my first
			piece of my puzzle cube, I was confident in Inventor at this point. The next step was to form the pieces into the cube itself. To do this I would assemble the parts using mate
			and flush constrain features. At the beginning it took me a while to understand how to constrain a piece to another piece and have it look correct, but after I fully constrained
			my cube, I was able to constrain pieces together much more confidentially and quicker. This Cube designed used only a few basic features, 2D sketch, rectangle tool, extrude, and
			mate and flush.

			My next artifact, the car project used many more skills and features such as; cut extrude, shell, fillet, mirror, revolve, insert constrain, and more.
			The car project tested my skills and showed me I definitely was as comfortable with some of these tools that I had learned from some of the lessons. During the car project
			I was constantly behind deadlines, I would always complete a task to realize that I had completed it wrong. But, I was able to use tutorials that were posted on schoology
			to gain better understanding of the ways that I need to use the tools and features in Inventor.
